#  Validation

Summary -- First investigations and validation of subgrid models. Build upon work already done both within the
collaboration and in the community as a whole.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS7.3.1 ( 12/16 ): Collect information about the current state-of-the-art relevant to dark energy
science goals.
* Key Task CS7.3.2 ( 12/16 ): Develop set of focused tests to address DESC relevant problems.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
